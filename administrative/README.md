# Administrative Custom Commands

## Export CC

| WARNING: This will send all your CCs as seperate files/messages, causing spam with a significant number of CCs
| --- |

Exports all your CCs as text files and provides direct download links to each.  
This command, by default, can only be run by administrators.  

To make downloading CCs easier, enable attachment archiving in ticket settings and run this CC in a ticket.  
Upon closing the ticket, it will compile all your CCs as files into a zip archive.
