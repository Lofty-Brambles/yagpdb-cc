# Administrative Custom Commands

## Export CC

| WARNING: This will send all your CCs as seperate files, causing spam in the channel you run it in
| --- |

Exports all your CCs as text files and provides direct download links to each.
This command can only be run by administrators (unless you edit it!)

Please note, this command will spam the channel you run it in

To make downloading CCs easier, enable attachment archiving in ticket settings and run the export CC in a ticket.
This will compile all your CCs as files into one convenient zip archive
