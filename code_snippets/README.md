## Flag Parser

Exactly what it sounds like, this can be used to parse flags for flexible command arguments.
Your templating can be put after the main block of code, in place of the example output.

The provided example output helps for setting up flags, and shows all parsed data formatted in an embed.
This allows for easy setup and a demonstration of how to retrieve parsed flags.

Flag contents are parsed as strings or boolean values, depending on whether or not text is given after the flag.
Example: (will add example gif at some point, essentially not providing text will parse the flag as a boolean 'true')
